# Caesar Cipher C Program

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption techniques in the C programming language. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter of the message is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features
- Encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Non-alphabet characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) are not modified.

## How it works
1. The program prompts the user to input a message that they want to encrypt or decrypt.
2. The program asks for a shift value (an integer) that defines how many positions each letter will be shifted in the alphabet.
3. It then either encrypts or decrypts the message based on the user's choice.
4. Finally, the program displays the resulting message (either encrypted or decrypted).
